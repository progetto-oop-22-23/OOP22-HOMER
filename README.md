## About The Project
HOMER is a smart home emulator. It allows to control multiple devices and sensors through a dashboard, and it's able to automatically
manage some scenarios to improve electrical consumption, air quality and heat waste.
Of course it's just an emulator, it won't open your windows or turn on any light in your house while you're sleeping, hopefully.
Features: 
 - [ ] Air quality tracking
 - [ ] Temperature tracking
 - [ ] Electrical consumption tracking
 - [ ] Graph view
 - [ ] Add and remove devices

 - [Michele Ceccacci]()
 - [Alessandro Monticelli]()
